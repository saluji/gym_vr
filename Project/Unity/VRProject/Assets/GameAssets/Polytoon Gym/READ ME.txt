Version: 1.0(inertia)

Thank you for downloading this growing package.

Please note that these models are specially unwrapped and the UV color effect will not work on other models in your scene,
however this package offers different color skins to adapt to your scene. Currently 24 models all share 1 texture and are 
between 6-120 polygons to see the exact poly count for each model please visit http://www.comphonia.com .

How to use:
to change the color of the model:
-------Manually (Fastest)------
- Select the poly toon material
- move the offset values of Y to choose a desired color and offset X to choose or swap different shade of the color.

------Automatically (More Accurate)-------
- Turn on the "_Material Offset" GameObject and hit play as the colors cycle through stop and copy the *material Y Offset value and paste it in 
  *Main Texture offset Y on the UV script.
- Input x on the axis (UV Offset script) and hit play again and stop when you have seen a desired shade.
- Turn off the _Material Offset GameObject and you have your custom skin.
